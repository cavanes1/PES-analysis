# SurfgenBound 2 PES analysis tools
Property of the Yarkony Group at Johns Hopkins University.

This is source code that generates various executables that can be used to analyze surfaces generated by [SurfgenBound 2](https://github.com/cavanes1/SurfgenBound2).
The initial commit version was provided by Yafu Guan.

The provided makefile runs successfully on ARCH.

## Python tools

### surfcurve.py
Given two points, this generates geom.all with linear synchronous transit points and calculates a curve plot using dat.x.

### view.py
Generates linear synchronous transit curve plots using dat.x for each internal coordinate and pair thereof.
Requires matplotlib. In ARCH, this can be loaded using the module matplotlib/3.5.2-foss-2022a, which itself requires GCC/11.3.0.

### enerr.py
Perform error analysis on the Hd surface.

### gf.py
Prepares the necessary data in order to perform a vibrational calculation using gf.x.
This can be used with ab initio data as well.

### ripgf.py
If using ab intio data with gf.py, this program is used to calculate the Hessian after the ab intio data has finished calculating.
