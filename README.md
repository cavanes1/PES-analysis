## Utilities

### Required input files for all
* basis.in
* Hd.CheckPoint
* refgeom
* intcfl

### dat.x
Required input files
* geom.all
* energy.all
* fit.in
* names.all

### findcp.x
Required input files
* findcp.in
* Geometry file (ex. geom)

For example, perform search on state 1 using "geom" as starting guess by running `findcp.x geom 1`

### findmex.x
Required input files
* mexopt.in
* Geometry file (ex. geom)

For example, perform search on states 1 and 2 using "geom" as starting guess by running `findmex.x geom 1 1`

### gf.x
Required input files
* energy.all
* geom.all

Output file: hess

### basis.x
Required input files
* basisest.in - has one parameter: NVS_contour
* precursor.xyz
* precursor.hess
* residual.xyz
* residual.hess

Output files:
