# SurfgenBound 2 PES analysis tools
This program was used for and is cited by [this research paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0214635) published in the Journal of Chemical Physics.
This program is used to analyze the diabatic potential energy matrix and derivative coupling matrix surfaces generated by [SurfgenBound 2](https://github.com/cavanes1/SurfgenBound2).
The provided makefile is designed for [ARCH](https://www.arch.jhu.edu/).

## Python tools
| File  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| surfcurve.py | Given two points, this generates geom.all with linear synchronous transit points and calculates a curve plot using dat.x. |
| view.py | Generates linear synchronous transit curve plots using dat.x for each internal coordinate and pair thereof. Requires matplotlib. In ARCH, this can be loaded using the module matplotlib/3.5.2-foss-2022a, which itself requires GCC/11.3.0. |
| enerr.py | Perform error analysis on the Hd surface. |
| gf.py | Prepares the necessary data in order to perform a vibrational calculation using gf.x. This can be used with ab initio data as well. |
| ripgf.py | If using ab intio data with gf.py, this program is used to calculate the Hessian after the ab intio data has finished calculating. |
